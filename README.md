A script that uses Google's Gemini API to allow users to ask questions to Google's Gemini AI and view the response from the terminal.

How to use:

First, create a file named `hiddenfile.txt` and paste in your Google API key as the first line in the file.


Create a Python virtual environment, activate the environment and then make sure you install all required dependencies by running

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

After that, simply go to your terminal and run `python script.py` and begin asking questions to Gemini!

You can exit the program by entering the word `exit`.
